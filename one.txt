0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:1.410
Yury Bialykh
Will you share your deck?
0:0:2.70 --> 0:0:3.570
Anatolii Lobanov
Yeah. Give me a SEC.
0:0:8.690 --> 0:0:10.590
Anatolii Lobanov
OK, this would be the right one.
0:0:11.100 --> 0:0:13.70
Yury Bialykh
Yeah, we can see it, OK.
0:0:13.40 --> 0:0:13.330
Anatolii Lobanov
So.
0:0:14.800 --> 0:0:20.430
Yury Bialykh
There's get going, I guess so. Hey, everyone. Again. For those who joined our.
0:0:21.70 --> 0:0:24.80
Yury Bialykh
Q&A session earlier last week, we we we've met before.
0:0:26.140 --> 0:0:31.850
Yury Bialykh
Thank you for joining. Thank you for willing to participate in our first AI hackathon.
0:0:33.440 --> 0:0:34.650
Yury Bialykh
It's.
0:0:35.590 --> 0:1:3.970
Yury Bialykh
It got quite an attention. So as you might have be aware, we are we've exceeded the limit that we originally set by 100% by more than 100%. We have a total of 41 participating teams right now. The teams are packed. So you'll be competing with roughly like 200 and 22140 people all over the world. We have folks from.
0:1:4.840 --> 0:1:14.350
Yury Bialykh
Most of the disciplines we have product managers, engineers, QA, BA, delivery managers, DevOps like we have everyone just great.
0:1:15.90 --> 0:1:41.560
Yury Bialykh
Uh, we've changed some of the format rules. We'll talk about it in a second to accommodate this. This number of teams, we didn't really we we didn't actually end up turning any teams out. So we accepted everyone. A couple teams just pulled off on their base on their own initiative, but we accepted everyone and that's what we wanted to do. So we had to make some adjustments in, in the process and in the format specially in how the judging will work. I'll talk about it in a second.
0:1:42.580 --> 0:1:59.390
Yury Bialykh
But other than that, we have a really great attendance and I hope we can convert it in, in, in awesome projects in the end on Monday. So we start today officially, we've just stored it.
0:2:1.150 --> 0:2:16.650
Yury Bialykh
So at the you officially can start the work. We'll talk about the format in a SEC. So stay, stay. Please stay on this on this call to get important details will be working all the weekends to Monday.
0:2:17.870 --> 0:2:31.880
Yury Bialykh
You'll be mostly working on your own. You don't need anything from us, but the org team will be around. The teams will still be the primary communication channel, so if you ever need anything, just reach out. We'll send you more communication later today. We'll talk about it in a second.
0:2:32.790 --> 0:2:34.620
Yury Bialykh
And then the car off date will be.
0:2:35.760 --> 0:2:41.140
Yury Bialykh
Monday, May 15, I think 12:00 PM you just see is like what eight 8:00 PM Eastern?
0:2:41.890 --> 0:2:43.70
Yury Bialykh
So something like this?
0:2:43.920 --> 0:2:47.880
Anatolii Lobanov
Uh, yes, 88 eastern E is 12, like noon, ETC.
0:2:48.180 --> 0:3:1.390
Yury Bialykh
Right, basically one hour before we start the demo sessions and there are a couple important steps that you need to take before the cut off time in order to to to remain in the game and not to be disqualified. And we'll talk about it in a second.
0:3:3.390 --> 0:3:6.560
Yury Bialykh
So you can go to the next slide. I don't really know how you order them so.
0:3:7.250 --> 0:3:19.180
Yury Bialykh
Yeah. So we already talked about that we are not restricted to use. You are allowed to use any technology, language, tool, whatever you want. You can host it wherever you want.
0:3:38.150 --> 0:3:38.400
Anatolii Lobanov
Sure.
0:3:21.730 --> 0:3:39.50
Yury Bialykh
There are a couple of restrictions in our end. You can quote wherever you want, but for the final submission and we'll talk about final submission at at at the end, we will require you actually it's right there. We will require you to move your code to the GitHub report. Can you go to the previous slide for a second?
0:3:40.810 --> 0:4:3.890
Yury Bialykh
Yes. So we will be sponsoring open AI API access as we said on the Q&A, you should have actually created those in advance. I mean you can create them right now, but open AI throttles the first couple days. So it might not be the pleasant experience. You can reuse existing accounts if you have them. That's totally fine the way the reimbursement will work and you get this communication after the hackathon.
0:4:5.750 --> 0:4:28.860
Yury Bialykh
We will reimburse one invoice from team according to our amount which is 120 bucks per team, which is the maximum amount that default account gets from open AI per month. So we'll just need an invoice for the month of May from your end and we'll reimburse it. But you can use any other tools. We just reimburse the open AI usage.
0:4:29.990 --> 0:5:0.680
Yury Bialykh
So these things will be at your disposal to to create your projects and and products according to the themes that we'll discuss in a second. What you will get later today shortly after this kickoff, you'll add the team captains will get a link to the final submission form that you will have to submit prior to the cut off date. This is extremely important. The late submissions might and probably will be disqualified. So this is the single most important.
0:5:1.100 --> 0:5:7.310
Yury Bialykh
Thing that you need to be thinking as you approach the end on on Monday. You can do it as early as possible.
0:5:8.520 --> 0:5:16.940
Yury Bialykh
So the form is quite simple. We'll request the you know the the the meta information from you.
0:5:17.740 --> 0:5:26.550
Yury Bialykh
Looked the team name and cetera, we'll have an executive summary that will be the short and concise description of your idea and implementation.
0:5:27.350 --> 0:5:31.90
Yury Bialykh
I'll focus on the problem you're trying to solve. Focus on how you solved it.
0:5:31.890 --> 0:5:41.460
Yury Bialykh
And focus on what was done during the hackathon, right? All these three things are important, and we'll talk more about it once we touch the judging criteria, the target category.
0:5:41.600 --> 0:6:5.210
Yury Bialykh
A list. It will be in the form like we have 3 categories. You can pick the categories you're going after cause you know but again you might be reassigned to different categories depending on how you do on the scoring. So the judges will actually make a decision on where you put it. You might end up in multiple categories, but if you know that, let's say you're focusing on engineering productivity. You can shortly mark this as the form and we'll take it into consideration.
0:6:5.860 --> 0:6:19.730
Yury Bialykh
That probably the single most important part of the submission is this demo link, so this will be the prerecorded demo of what you've been able to accomplish during the hackathon will limit it to 6 minutes.
0:6:21.170 --> 0:6:49.620
Yury Bialykh
So just again that if you go over limits, you might be disqualified. I'll just that the rest will be ignored. So thank you. Through think about it as your elevator pitch. Like pack your content, you can rehearse mobile. It's prerecorded. So it's do it at your own pace again. Focus on explaining the idea that you have explaining the solution and then proving what you've done right, showing what you've done during the hackathon.
0:6:50.660 --> 0:7:20.310
Yury Bialykh
This is very important because as I'll start explaining you the format you'll you'll you'll know you'll know why because of the scale, a lot of judgment will be done offline. So this is very important to have this. The next part would be quote. Again, we're not really you can develop whatever you want. You can start it start in the GitLab already or you can put it in any it's your code, you own it, you can put it whatever you want. But for the final submission because.
0:7:20.480 --> 0:7:51.270
Yury Bialykh
We'll need judges to have access to your source code to examine it, and again to to score. We have the technical excellence category. We'll ask you to move your code prior to the cut off date to the Git lab, to EPAM, GitLab so that it is accessible for our judges. Right. And we the rule is also that you cannot, there cannot be commits past the cut off date. Otherwise you'll risk in the be disqualified.
0:7:53.160 --> 0:8:23.710
Yury Bialykh
If you like at the demo link again should be a the the demo itself should be uploaded to the SharePoint and the link should be shared and there will be more instructions in the form, but I just wanted to walk through the main parts and then the last block is supporting materials. Anything else that you'd like to attach? Diagrams, wireframes, more content? So it's an extra if you want it to be considered. It's optional and again depending on how much time we'll have, we might get to it. We might not, but make sure that the demo and the code and the description is there.
0:8:23.810 --> 0:8:54.880
Yury Bialykh
That's the most important part and everything else. You just drop it into SharePoint, you make it accessible for everyone inside EPAM and you will touch the link to the form. We have some requests from teams if you wanna restrict the access to your demo or to your code for whatever reason. It's also possible just reach out to the org team will give you the names, and we need an access that will be our entire jury panel. Maybe some of the org team members and you can you can restrict the access to just this.
0:8:55.40 --> 0:9:18.710
Yury Bialykh
But by default, to make it simpler, just make it available for everyone inside EPAM and and and send the link. So again you'll get the form the form is ready to go. You'll get it later today, probably right after the kickoff, and your responsibility would be to fill and submit the form prior to cut off date. This is the single most important thing other than actually building the prototype that you need to keep in mind.
0:9:19.710 --> 0:9:22.630
Yury Bialykh
OK. Can we go to the next one and I'll take questions at the end, of course.
0:9:23.530 --> 0:9:27.570
Yury Bialykh
So now, demos, demos will be on Monday. So.
0:9:29.270 --> 0:9:38.950
Yury Bialykh
You eat every captain or every team member should already have an invite for Monday demo sessions. The demos because of the scale we.
0:9:39.680 --> 0:9:42.690
Yury Bialykh
Randomly split the teams into three groups.
0:9:43.810 --> 0:9:48.420
Yury Bialykh
And then we Samy randomly split the judges into three groups.
0:9:49.240 --> 0:9:59.180
Yury Bialykh
Semi randomly because each group should have someone who is focused on technology, on product, on design, on digital, so that they're balanced and.
0:9:59.980 --> 0:10:10.430
Yury Bialykh
There will be 3 demos streams going in parallel on Monday, so if you have an invite, you have an invite for your own stream for for for where you are will be presenting the.
0:10:12.190 --> 0:10:24.650
Yury Bialykh
Demos will go in order, so the order is in the invite and will also keep you updated because some teams might wanna drop off from the from the hackathon and we'll have to rebalance the.
0:10:25.480 --> 0:10:41.460
Yury Bialykh
Sessions. So we'll we'll we'll be communicating with you actively if if there are any any changes, but the demo will be for each individual group. You'll have judges from your group and you'll have other teams from your group attending the session you'll have.
0:10:42.680 --> 0:11:10.730
Yury Bialykh
10 minutes total for your demo. So six minute for the actual demo. The same demo that you prerecorded like the same format and then 4 minutes. For the Q&A, we'll have moderators in each session that will be actively policing for time just to make sure that we keep moving and we allowing the teams that are going after you to present right. So be concise. We will not allow to go over because we wanna everyone to give it a chance to present.
0:11:12.190 --> 0:11:31.850
Yury Bialykh
You can stay for the whole demo. You can. You can. You'll get your time slot. You can just show for your time slot, like 10 minutes prior. Probably maybe 15, just to make sure we account for in shift and you're welcome to, like, roam around and check other demos. We are planning to broadcast them for everyone. So if you just wanna.
0:11:32.190 --> 0:11:46.640
Yury Bialykh
You know, just check out what out of the teams are presenting. You can do this so judges will be on those demos and they might ask questions. Let's just suit to be prepared for it. Again. The important part here is.
0:11:47.350 --> 0:11:52.840
Yury Bialykh
Know when and now when you're presenting, be there. Be ready to do your demo.
0:11:53.960 --> 0:12:17.370
Yury Bialykh
It can be a live demo. You you know you can do the prerecording whatever. If you fear that something will not work and the life matter like prepare fake it. Whatever this is, it's it's on you and then the Q&A and the timing is very important. So make sure that you are within this 10 minutes time frame because they said we will not be able to give you more time because we have more than 40 teams.
0:12:19.870 --> 0:12:21.280
Yury Bialykh
You can go to the next one please.
0:12:23.610 --> 0:12:53.260
Yury Bialykh
Yes. So the judging the judging will work as following. There will be 2 phases and again the the, the the design here was done to make sure that we give enough throughput for the judge and team and we're also limiting the load on a single judgment team member because we have for the teams just just a lot of content to go through. So as I said, the judges will be.
0:12:53.560 --> 0:12:55.450
Yury Bialykh
Already split into.
0:12:56.710 --> 0:13:11.550
Yury Bialykh
Groups and they'll assigned the team group right? So we have three groups, so each judge will have a group assigned and they also have a primary category like this is their focus like technology or design or.
0:13:13.520 --> 0:13:15.620
Yury Bialykh
Product management or or digital?
0:13:16.260 --> 0:13:46.860
Yury Bialykh
So for phase one, judges will attend the demos and review your demos live during the demo sessions. Or if some cannot make it or cannot make it for the entire duration. They can also catch up reviewing your recordings, right? That's why recordings are extremely important, like this is very important artifact. So the way we structure the format for judges, their score and their primary group first, that will be roughly 14 teams per group.
0:13:47.20 --> 0:13:56.80
Yury Bialykh
So judges are scoring those fourteen teams first after that and and those would be the teams that will present on the demo. So they either do it live.
0:13:56.850 --> 0:14:28.620
Yury Bialykh
Or they do it after that by reviewing recordings or they do both. After that, they're free to go and score any other teams they'll have access to all the other submissions, but they must score their primary group first. By doing that, we at minimum they need to score 14. They need to score. They do not need to score 41, and we are guaranteeing the scoring coverage for every single team from a balanced set of judges. Right after that, they can go and score other teams if they want to review the recording again. That's why providing the recording materials is extremely important.
0:14:28.760 --> 0:14:31.630
Yury Bialykh
Was checked into the more offline score and just took commodate the scale.
0:14:32.500 --> 0:14:38.890
Yury Bialykh
Once we're done with space one, the org team will, based on the scoring from phase one, will.
0:14:39.610 --> 0:14:40.180
Yury Bialykh
Group.
0:14:41.270 --> 0:14:56.640
Yury Bialykh
And I'll talk about the scoring in a second, will I mean the criteria will group the submissions into short list for each category depending on the feedback from the judges. And we'll present this list for the phase one back to the judges, right. So we'll have a short list for.
0:14:57.370 --> 0:15:3.950
Yury Bialykh
Best intact and shortlist for best in digital and the for the shortlist for best in in design and all our other categories.
0:15:4.730 --> 0:15:34.560
Yury Bialykh
So the judges will reconvene again and they'll score within the same short list. Well, with within each short list by picking the winner. And the way it's gonna work again, some judges who whose primary focus is within the category, like those that are focused on tech, must score their category first before they can proceed to other categories and their vote will be weighted. They'll have more votes, basically. So this will guarantee that people who understand the category are.
0:15:34.670 --> 0:16:5.230
Yury Bialykh
Hey 8 score in the teams and the category and B have a have more have more words. So that's where actually getting the better results. And then the Grand Prix will be assigned in the same at the same time. So after these two phases we'll have winners in each category and the Grand Prix, as you can see, the process is not complicated, but there has a lot of steps and we have a lot of judges and they're all busy people. So our ambitious timeline is to do.
0:16:5.320 --> 0:16:21.680
Yury Bialykh
Should be done with phase one and one day, and then have two days to complete the phase two. But things might change as we might need to know run up to judges and and and figure out. So we'll we'll keep you updated if if we need more time, but that's the goal. That's model.
0:16:22.400 --> 0:16:52.630
Yury Bialykh
Is balancing the amount of judging and needs to be happen for for one member and it's also making sure that each team is being reviewed by a balanced team of judges with all the necessary skill set, and if they get into the category within category, whoever is an expert in this category also gets a chance to review them so you can see it's some of it offline based. So again make sure that you're recording your coding and artifacts are there.
0:16:52.920 --> 0:16:58.820
Yury Bialykh
After submitted our accessible otherwise you know, judges just won't be able to to to score you.
0:16:59.570 --> 0:17:0.530
Yury Bialykh
Can we go to the next one?
0:17:1.290 --> 0:17:31.200
Yury Bialykh
So the way the judge is gonna work, they'll have a special template that we're not gonna show you, but basically it there, there are five main criterias and three of them have different aspects of it. So first would be the problem solution fit and we assess the impact and the value proposition like how good is your idea, what is the value proposition for whatever problem you're trying to solve for the customers or for the users that you're aiming. And then also the business viability, right? You might have the best idea in the world.
0:17:31.290 --> 0:17:37.480
Yury Bialykh
But it's just simply not possible to implement, so it might be realistic. So the business viability is best proven by.
0:17:38.80 --> 0:18:10.490
Yury Bialykh
Doing a good demo, but actually proving it during the hackathon, but actually building something that proves that you can move into this direction. So these are the first two criteria that technological complexity in excellence first mainly focused on the UI, how well the I is incorporated from a technology perspective, this is the main criteria here. And then after that overall technological complexity of the solution, same for the design and UX first how well the UI is incorporated into the design of your application. What aspects of the design I changed to incorporate the UI.
0:18:10.630 --> 0:18:19.80
Yury Bialykh
What? And then the overall design and user experience of the product that you've built in? And then two specials alignment with the digital theme, how well?
0:18:20.0 --> 0:18:28.140
Yury Bialykh
Your product is can be fitted into the digital ecosystem and impact on the general productivity. And again, if you're going after it.
0:18:28.970 --> 0:18:33.900
Yury Bialykh
They'll, they'll says, based on this criteria, so and then there's the scoring framework behind it, but it doesn't matter.
0:18:35.790 --> 0:19:5.800
Yury Bialykh
These are the main things, and then as you can see, yeah, the the there's a design to assess from from multiple dimensions. Can we go to the next one till I think we have a couple more couple more left yeah. So these are the main categories that will be included into form that have been shared previously yeah. And digital technology yeah. And next Gen. UI and engineering productivity and then special categories on tenant technology use and the problem solution feed. So this will be defined and format that I explained for this one phase two.
0:19:6.40 --> 0:19:26.600
Yury Bialykh
And then the Grand Prix. This is like the best of the best. Will be also assigned during the sometime at the face to the we you should have the invite. If not there's a placeholder will send you the invite for the winner announcement. Again depending on how well and how well we can progress through in the judgment we we target.
0:19:31.350 --> 0:19:31.920
Anatolii Lobanov
Yes.
0:19:28.200 --> 0:19:52.530
Yury Bialykh
May 10th, which is, I believe Thursday next week, right to to announce, to announce the winner and then after that we'll do probably we'll do more communication we'll do highlights because we expect a lot of good submissions. So we want to do highlights. We want to talk about different formats but like at minimum we will plan to announce the winners end of next week.
0:19:54.160 --> 0:20:3.520
Yury Bialykh
For the categories you can see there remained the same. They're fairly brought intentionally, so categories and judging criteria are your main.
0:20:4.530 --> 0:20:21.800
Yury Bialykh
Guiding posts in your design process like it like, look at the categories and look at how it will be scored to design to decide of what kind of idea you wanted to explore again and make sure that you actually build a working prototype to prove the viability.
0:20:23.20 --> 0:20:27.620
Yury Bialykh
And I think this is the last slide told you I think the next one is your.
0:20:28.470 --> 0:20:36.510
Yury Bialykh
Uh cloud of text with with different things that might inspire teams, I guess to to think uh and then move into the right direction.
0:20:37.350 --> 0:20:58.420
Yury Bialykh
Will sum up everything, and we'll pause this deck and we'll post more communication in the teams later today, so you'll have all of that. You'll get the form for the submission explaining the same thing again. You should have an invite for Monday with your presenting time frame, and we will be around for the entire.
0:21:1.20 --> 0:21:3.670
Yury Bialykh
Hackathon duration. So if you ever need something.
0:21:4.300 --> 0:21:5.130
Yury Bialykh
Please reach out.
0:21:5.790 --> 0:21:11.240
Yury Bialykh
OK, now we'll start taking questions first by.
0:21:12.740 --> 0:21:17.540
Yury Bialykh
Looking at the charts, share the presentation. OK, we'll do this.
0:21:18.670 --> 0:21:41.860
Yury Bialykh
If some teams and knowledge is the similar problem presents similar to how we handled, I mean your implementation will be different. That's totally fine. In fact, that actually might be even desirable, right? That that that I don't believe that you'll implement it in the same way you might go after the same problem, but the implementation is what matters here. So I don't see any problems there. So fine.
0:21:42.960 --> 0:22:5.50
Yury Bialykh
What at the time of cut off Daria, there would be 8:00 AM EST Monday, one hour before the demo and you should submit your form prior to the cut off date, right? So just don't wait till the very end. You should you can submit it earlier. In fact for the for the code for example you can if you already have your recording.
0:22:6.120 --> 0:22:30.310
Yury Bialykh
And but you still wanna do some polishing on the court. You can submit your form earlier and work on your code up until the cut off date because you can submit the link to the repository, we just won't accept repositories with commits after the the cut off date, but you can commit prior to cut off date. So think about when you're gonna submit the final form in advance place so that it's not a mad dash at the end because it's. This is really important.
0:22:32.970 --> 0:22:38.760
Yury Bialykh
Yeah. So the other demo recordings will be published once we consulted everything the.
0:22:39.680 --> 0:22:40.610
Yury Bialykh
Actual.
0:22:41.320 --> 0:22:49.370
Yury Bialykh
Uh demo sessions and toilet keep me honest. Here are supposed to be streamed live. Is this still the plan?
0:22:50.0 --> 0:22:58.0
Anatolii Lobanov
Uh, yes, that's the plan. So we are all tech tech based on this today and on Monday, but the plan is to stream, yeah.
0:22:58.160 --> 0:23:11.630
Yury Bialykh
OK. I mean you you probably won't have time to go around and watch out the recorded, but if you do or if your friends wants to check it out, all three demo sessions on Monday will be streamed live like you can, you can, you will, it's on weird community.
0:23:12.350 --> 0:23:32.620
Yury Bialykh
After that, the recording of the demo sessions, the live demos and the recording that we compiled will move it somewhere, but give us some time. Like for the God's 41 team we're dealing with like we'll we'll we we wanna highlight the good work that's been done. I'm sure there will be some interesting stories to talk about and some interesting cases to examine, even though they're not be part of the winning categories. So.
0:23:33.360 --> 0:23:39.970
Yury Bialykh
We'll we'll need some time to process it, but we'll try to share as much as possible with with you. Uh participants.
0:23:43.110 --> 0:23:44.400
Yury Bialykh
Any other questions?
0:23:50.950 --> 0:23:55.860
Yury Bialykh
OK then. Good luck. Have fun. We'll.
0:23:56.570 --> 0:23:58.190
Yury Bialykh
Sure. Hovik, go ahead.
0:23:55.170 --> 0:24:7.600
Hovik Tamazyan
One more question, sorry for interrupt you before. Before demo of the product should be demonstrate the team structure or how we did the discovery phase or just product demonstration.
0:24:6.720 --> 0:24:39.400
Yury Bialykh
So, OK, great question again. I think someone asked it about the structure of the demo. Do you need to bring deck, do you need to have a PowerPoint? It's up to you. So it whatever you feel best, whatever you feel will best convey your idea and implementation and the process like included in the demo. You obviously have a limited amount of time. You have just six minutes, but it's app to you what you wanna do if you want to showcase the work by highlighting people who participated or highlighting the process that you've gone through to arrive to idea.
0:24:39.860 --> 0:25:6.0
Yury Bialykh
That's fine. You can do this. Plus remember, in addition to your main demo, which is the most important artifact, you can also submit other support and artifacts, right? No guarantee that the judges will get to it, but you can server. So it's on you to how you want to structure it. You wanna have a PowerPoint and show the PowerPoint, go for it. You wanna do the live demo and just show the code, go for it, whatever you feel.
0:25:6.670 --> 0:25:19.890
Yury Bialykh
Uh illustrates a your problem B your solution and what was done during the hackathon time. Like whatever you feel better illustrated like, go for it. No other restrictions.
0:25:20.500 --> 0:25:21.510
Hovik Tamazyan
OK. OK. Thank you.
0:25:23.630 --> 0:25:24.310
Yury Bialykh
Uh.
0:25:25.950 --> 0:25:57.620
Yury Bialykh
Can we get access open API access for free from DEP time? We need to just no. So you'll have to purchase it like we we will not distribute their organization cause otherwise we'll have to organizational API keys, otherwise we'll have to impose the limits on each team. And there's no easy way to do this with opening I we explore this option. We do have a corporate account there and we do have API keys, but they're just no way, no simple way to restrict the access and isolate neighbors because there will be a lot of you. So the easiest, the easiest way would be just to use your private.
0:25:57.850 --> 0:26:20.450
Yury Bialykh
Your own account or someone from your team, just make sure it's one account, cause we'll accept one invoice and and just submit the invoice after the hackathon and you'll be reimbursed and all the like where to click and cost objects. All the data will be shared with you after the hackathon. We don't wanna overload you right now, but essentially it's just a report in Concur that you'll need to fill.
0:26:24.730 --> 0:26:26.280
Yury Bialykh
Any other questions?
0:26:34.860 --> 0:26:49.20
Yury Bialykh
But I'm not sure. I think we do. I'm not even sure how we use it. I know that we have an EPAM org and I don't know if war is activated, like by default if they didn't change anything, you'll get 3.5.
0:26:49.600 --> 0:27:8.530
Yury Bialykh
Uh, in your normal private account, unless you sign up for beta, which is pretty hard to do because you know their cost, restrictive 3.5 should do fine. I mean, and you can use any other, you can use any other API that they provide. It's not just GPT. You can use any specialized like, you know, whisper and stuff like that. So.
0:27:10.500 --> 0:27:13.570
Yury Bialykh
Yeah, I'm not sure if if we as a corporate have access to to four.
0:27:15.240 --> 0:27:16.290
Yury Bialykh
Any other questions, Dean?
0:27:19.340 --> 0:27:22.160
Yury Bialykh
Yes, of course. Very good question. So.
0:27:23.60 --> 0:27:53.190
Yury Bialykh
For the live demos on Monday, if this is your first hackathon, things will go wrong for sure. Live demos never go according to plan, just have a backup plan. The best backup plan would be to just use your pre recorded demo or just use artifacts, right? So ideally the demo for Monday is not really to prove that it works in real time, but not to have the interaction with the judges so they can ask questions right? But it would be great if you actually show with live.
0:27:53.670 --> 0:28:9.970
Yury Bialykh
Right. But be prepared because things will go wrong. Things like make sure you have, you know, screen shots or pre recordings or you have a story that you'll tell if everything breaks the pieces because things will break for sure. That's how things are in live demos.
0:28:11.190 --> 0:28:12.520
Yury Bialykh
Just just be ready for that.
0:28:15.300 --> 0:28:20.920
Anatolii Lobanov
For everybody will have the Pre recorded demo anyway, so and that's what this is. One of the reasons why we must have it.
0:28:21.520 --> 0:28:30.530
Yury Bialykh
Exactly. Exactly. So the, the, I would say that the predict quadrant is the most important part. The live demo is the second most important part.
0:28:31.870 --> 0:28:36.520
Yury Bialykh
If you deploy your application somewhere and it's accessible, just share the link.
0:28:37.310 --> 0:28:40.800
Yury Bialykh
Also works. You'll have this place in the material section. Just can share the link.
0:28:41.490 --> 0:28:45.580
Yury Bialykh
Not required, but if it's there, just just just shared the link.
0:28:48.510 --> 0:28:49.950
Yury Bialykh
OK. Any other questions?
0:28:53.400 --> 0:29:12.290
Yury Bialykh
Well, great then then, as I said, have fun. Good luck. If you need anything, just reach out to the org team like myself and Italian. Anna, just talk to anyone in on the teams channel. We'll we'll respond and we'll be communicating with you actively during the process. Or, Tom, you have your hand up. Do you have a question?
0:29:21.690 --> 0:29:22.260
Yury Bialykh
Oh, I see.
0:29:13.160 --> 0:29:25.530
Artem Arefev
Yes, thank you. Sent to our chat, but let me use my voice. So please could you repeat any additional milestone? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just to understand our plan.
0:29:27.220 --> 0:29:27.570
Artem Arefev
Umm.
0:29:25.90 --> 0:29:55.860
Yury Bialykh
No, no, no, no, sorry. Like maybe you joined like, no, no, no. Milestones. What do you need to do? You'll get a link to the final form today later today, the form is ready to go. We'll, we'll we didn't we just didn't want it to send it before this meeting so that I could explain it to you. You'll get the form and you'll know your cut off date. Well. Everyone knows that it's 8:00 AM EST Monday. So all you need to do is to make sure that your form is submitted prior to the cut off date and that you're ready to present and demo on Monday according to your time frame that you should have an account. That's it. No either intermediate milestones.
0:29:56.310 --> 0:30:12.400
Yury Bialykh
Nothing. If you need anything, just reach out. There might be some unexpected things happening, like an open the eye goes down. We'll we'll monitor and we'll pivot like we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll we'll figure out. But other than that, if everything goes smooth.
0:30:13.30 --> 0:30:13.640
Yury Bialykh
Uh.
0:30:20.950 --> 0:30:21.310
Artem Arefev
Thank you.
0:30:15.70 --> 0:30:21.400
Yury Bialykh
You could you just you just need to be prepared to submit your form and we have another hand. Uh from.
0:30:22.870 --> 0:30:24.480
Yury Bialykh
Yeah, go ahead, junior.
0:30:21.750 --> 0:30:35.880
Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah. So do you provide any kind of advice and service, you mean like for teams who need maybe additional feedback or advice from, I don't know, some professionals how to finalize the product, something like that?
0:30:36.570 --> 0:30:37.100
Yury Bialykh
I'm.
0:30:39.120 --> 0:31:8.950
Yury Bialykh
We didn't. We didn't design the mentorship parts intentionally, but if you do need an ad hoc basis, if you do need to talk to someone, if you do need to. If you do know, where do we need help? Again, just reach out to the org team will try to connect you with someone. This is not something that will be able to do for everyone, I guess because we didn't really plan for this. We didn't really have a scalable pool of people, but we have judges and we have experts. So if you do need help with anything.
0:31:9.60 --> 0:31:12.770
Yury Bialykh
Just reach out to the org team. We'll try to get you in touch with someone who can help.
0:31:14.20 --> 0:31:14.910
Speaker 1
Perfect. Thank you.
0:31:18.330 --> 0:31:21.980
Yury Bialykh
OK. And I will for the third time, I'll attempt to close the call.
0:31:23.580 --> 0:31:28.820
Yury Bialykh
I'll do it slowly this time so that people can have time to interrupt on us questions.
0:31:29.800 --> 0:31:56.550
Yury Bialykh
Good luck and have fun. First of all, like don't think about winning or anything like we have a good crowd here. We have a very excited topic to explore. I'm very pleased with the amount of response we got. We have a very talented team here across disciplinary. I'm sure you'll do very good. So first of all, just focus on having fun. We'll be around if you need anything from our team, just reach out and we'll also be actively reaching out to you, sending you some updates on communications.
0:31:57.470 --> 0:32:3.980
Yury Bialykh
OK, alright, team. Thank you again. Good luck and talk to you soon. Take care. Bye bye.
